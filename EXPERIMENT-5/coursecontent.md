Implement quicksort by considering pivot as first element, last element, mid element and random element. Perform time (best, worst, and average) and space complexity analysis.

After implementing mergesort and quicksort compare their performance for the same set of elements and draw graph for the execution time.

Implement and compare the performance of Strassen method of matrix multiplication with traditional way of matrix multiplication.

Implement Kadane algorithm for maximum sum sub-array.
