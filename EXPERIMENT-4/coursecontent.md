Write programs for the following sorting algorithms:

Selection sort

Bubble sort

Insertion sort

Merge sort.
Perform time and space complexity analysis of the above codes. Write and solve recurrence relation of mergesort in all the cases (best, worst, and average).
Implement merge sort using linked list and perform time and space complexity analysis.
