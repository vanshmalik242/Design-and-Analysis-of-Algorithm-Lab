1. **Selection Sort Time Complexity**:
   - **Best Case**: O(n^2)
   - **Average Case**: O(n^2)
   - **Worst Case**: O(n^2)
   - **Space Complexity**: O(1)
**2) Bubble Sort
Time Complexity:
Best Case: ( O(n) ) (when the array is already sorted)
Average Case: ( O(n^2) )
Worst Case: ( O(n^2) )
Space Complexity: ( O(1) )**

**3) Insertion Sort
Time Complexity:
Best Case: ( O(n) ) (when the array is already sorted)
Average Case: ( O(n^2) )
Worst Case: ( O(n^2) )
Space Complexity: ( O(1) )**

**5) Merge Sort
Recurrence Relation: ( T(n) = 2T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + O(n) )
Time Complexity:
Best Case: ( O(n \log n) )
Average Case: ( O(n \log n) )
Worst Case: ( O(n \log n) )
Space Complexity: ( O(n) ) (for temporary arrays during merging)**

**6) Merge Sort Using Linked List
Time Complexity: ( O(n \log n) ) (all cases)
Space Complexity: ( O(1) ) (in-place with call stack usage)**
